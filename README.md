# Logistic-Regression
This mini project uses Logistic Regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
The project covers reading the dataset, splitting the data, training a logistic regression model, and evaluating it using basic metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. It also explains how logistic regression uses the sigmoid function to output probabilities.
